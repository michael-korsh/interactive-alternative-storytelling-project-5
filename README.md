# interactive-story-quiz
I produced this quiz for an alternative storytelling assignment for Foundations of Interactive Journalism, during the fall 2021 quarter of my MSJ program. The content is based on [a story I wrote for Kiplinger's Personal Finance](https://www.kiplinger.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/603330/think-twice-about-applying-for-credit).
