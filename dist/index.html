<div class="question" id="Q1">

  <div>
    <p><span id="Q">Question 1: </span>Americans paid down
billions in credit card debt during the pandemic. How much did balances decline in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a year earlier?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="answers">
    <div class="answer" id="incorrect-1">
      <span class="option">A.</span> 10%
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="incorrect-1">
      <span class="option">B.</span> 12%
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="correct-1">
      <span class="option">C.</span> 17%
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="incorrect-1">
      <span class="option">D.</span> 20%
    </div>
  </div>

  <button onclick="tl1.play()">Show correct answer</button>

  <p class="explanation" id="explanation-1"><span id="correct-repeat">17%. </span>According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, credit card balances declined 17% from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021.
  <p class="explanation" id="explanation-1"> So, credit card issuers are eager to entice new applicants with flashy deals and sign-up bonuses. For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Visa and the American Express Platinum card are offering up to 100,000 bonus points for new cardholders.</p>
  <p class="explanation" id="explanation-1">While you might be inclined to take advantage of these deals, some short-term credit decisions could lead to long-term damage to your credit score.</p>

</div>

<div class="question" id="Q2">

  <div>
    <p><span id="Q">Question 2: </span>If you already have a credit history and are looking to apply for new credit, your biggest consideration is timing. Applying for a credit card will trigger a <span style="font-weight:700;">"hard inquiry”</span> into your credit report. How many points are deducted from your credit score for each hard inquiry?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="answers">
    <div class="answer" id="correct-2">
      <span class="option">A.</span> 2-5 points
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="incorrect-2">
      <span class="option">B.</span> 1-3 points
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="incorrect-2">
      <span class="option">C.</span> 4-6 points
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="incorrect-2">
      <span class="option">D.</span> 8-10 points
    </div>
  </div>

  <button onclick="tl2.play()">Show correct answer</button>

  <p class="explanation" id="explanation-2" ><span id="correct-repeat">2-5 points.</span> For that reason, if you’re looking to apply for an auto loan or mortgage, hold off on credit card applications so you can secure the lowest interest rates possible.
</div>

<div class="question" id="Q3">

  <div>
    <p><span id="Q">Question 3: </span>If you're applying for a mortgage, how long do experts recommend avoiding new credit applications?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="answers">
    <div class="answer" id="incorrect-3">
      <span class="option">A.</span> 1 month.
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="incorrect-3">
      <span class="option">B.</span> 3 months.
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="incorrect-3">
      <span class="option">C.</span> 4 months.
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="correct-3">
      <span class="option">D.</span> 6 months.
    </div>
  </div>

  <button onclick="tl3.play()">Show correct answer</button>

  <p class="explanation" id="explanation-3"> <span id="correct-repeat">6 months. </span>Credit expert John Ulzheimer, author of <span style="font-style:italic">The Smart Consumer’s Guide to Good Credit,</span> goes so far as to suggest a year of “credit downtime.”</p>

</div>

<div class="question" id="Q4">

  <div>
    <p><span id="Q">Question 4: </span>Even if you’re not taking out a significant loan soon, there are other timing considerations that come into play. Credit expert Gerri Detweiler, author of <span style="font-style: italic">The Ultimate Credit Handbook,</span> explains that although multiple mortgage and auto loan inquiries in the same time period (about 14 to 45 days) are often grouped together in your credit report and won’t hurt your score, that’s not the case for credit cards.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 10px">Because each individual hard inquiry will impact your credit score, how long does Beverly Harzog, author of <span style="font-style: italic">The Debt Escape Plan,</span> suggest waiting between new applications?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="answers">
    <div class="answer" id="incorrect-4">
      <span class="option">A.</span> 2-3 months.
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="correct-4">
      <span class="option">B.</span> 4-6 months.
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="incorrect-4">
      <span class="option">C.</span> 6-8 months.

      <span class="option">D.</span> 8-10 months.
    </div>
  </div>

  <button onclick="tl4.play()">Show correct answer</button>

  <p class="explanation" id="explanation-4"> <span id="correct-repeat">4-6 months. </span> In addition, applying
for multiple credit cards to reap the benefits of rewards or sign-up bonuses—a practice known as credit card stacking—could backfire. Credit card companies are aware of this practice and may deny your application if they think you’re trying to stockpile rewards.</p>

</div>

<div class="question" id="Q5">

  <div>
    <p><span id="Q">Question 5: </span>If you don’t have a credit history—you’re a college student, for example, or
a recent graduate—you’re unlikely to be approved for most of these credit card offers. Instead, work on developing a good credit history so you’ll qualify for low rates and generous incentives in the future.
      <p style="margin-top: 10px">One way to build new credit is a <span style="font-weight:700">secured credit card.</span> With this option, you put down an initial deposit that serves as your credit limit. As you build credit, you can switch to a traditional unsecured credit card with a higher limit.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px">How much is a typical deposit for a secured credit card?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="answers">
    <div class="answer" id="incorrect-5">
      <span class="option">A.</span> $50-$100.

      <span class="option">B.</span> $150-$250.

      <span class="option">D.</span> $500-$750.
    </div>
  </div>

  <button onclick="tl5.play()">Show correct answer</button>

  <p class="explanation" id="explanation-5"> <span id="correct-repeat">$300-$500. </span> Many major credit card issuers also offer student credit cards, which have lower credit limits and student-friendly rewards to help new users develop a responsible credit history.</p>
